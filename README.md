**Refugio** 

### High-Level Summary

 **Refugio** is an innovative dual-purpose project designed to enhance disaster response and recovery efforts, particularly focusing on vulnerable populations, especially women and children. Our initiative comprises two key components: 
 
 1. **Blockchain-Driven Tool Kit**: We developed a comprehensive tool kit that leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, trust, traceability, and effective emergency management. By utilizing smart contracts and attestations, we aim to address critical issues within the donation supply chain, such as the loss of funds and lack of transparency in financial transactions. Our tool enables real-time tracking of donations, ensuring that funds are allocated appropriately and impactfully. Additionally, we integrated the EONET NASA API to monitor natural events and deliver timely alerts to NGOs operating in disaster-prone areas, facilitating rapid and coordinated responses.
 
  2. **Gender-Focused Donation Organization**: Recognizing that women are often the most vulnerable demographic during natural disasters, **Refugio.today** was established to gather donations specifically aimed at supporting women and their children in crisis situations. This organization serves as a testing ground for our blockchain tool kit, allowing us to refine its features based on real-world effectiveness. By collaborating with Effective Altruism organizations, we aim to share our findings and tools to enhance their operations, making charitable activities more efficient, transparent, and trustworthy. Furthermore, our approach opens new avenues for funding through cryptocurrencies, providing a sustainable and verifiable supply chain. 
  
  ### Importance 
  
  The intersection of technology and humanitarian aid is crucial in today's rapidly changing climate. **Refugio** addresses pressing issues of accountability and efficiency in disaster response while championing gender justice. By equipping NGOs with the tools they need to act swiftly and transparently, we can improve outcomes for those affected by natural disasters and empower marginalized groups. Our project not only fosters community resilience but also promotes a culture of trust and collaboration in the humanitarian sector.
